# Notes-App

It is developed using **React**. We can add notes, delete, and preview the notes we type on a real-time basis, and markdown is supported.

I have used **react-markdown** to enable the markdown in the notes preview.

Also, used **react-uuid** for generating random ids so that we can sync between our _SideBar_ and _MainBar_ also with _Preview_ part of web app.

Also implemented the functionality of **local storage**
